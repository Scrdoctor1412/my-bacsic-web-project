                    <p>Yes. Please follow these steps to cancel your pre-order for a full refund of your deposit:
                        <br> <br>
                        1. Sign into your ThinkPad account <br>
                        2. Navigate to the orders section of your account profile <br>
                        3. Select Cancel on the open pre-order <br>
                        4. Note that once your final payment has been processed, and order cannot be canceled via the
                        method mentioned above and you will need to contact Framework Support for available options.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you would like to modify your pre-order instead, please reach out to Framework Support.

                    <p>
                        Once the final balance is captured for an order it is not possible to change the shipping
                        address, as we transmit orders for fulfilment immediately.
                        <br> <br>
                        You can change the shipping address on a pre-order at any point up to the time the balance of
                        payment is charged. Updating your default address will also update the shipping address on any
                        unshipped pre-orders. To do this, you can log into your Framework Account and change your
                        default Saved Address.
                        <br> <br>
                        Note that your order summary page may still show the original address that was entered when you
                        placed your pre-order.
